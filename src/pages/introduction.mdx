## Introduction
- It is basically a way of designing a system
- It is a process of defining different components in a system, and how they communicate between each other and how the data flow between them effectively.
- Anything and everything it takes for the product from scratch to production so that end users can use it is called system design.
- There is no correct or wrong answer while designing. Just that logically the system that you designed should make sense.

## Types of System Design
- HLD (High Level Design)
- LLD (Low Level Design)

### HLD (High Level Design)
It basically means designing the system on a very high level overview. And it is often done by breaking the problem statements into smaller components/architecture, their communication etc.
**Some steps that goes to HLD are:**
1. Understand the problem statement.
2. Requirement Analysis
	- Functional Requirement
	- Non Functional Requirement
	- Ex: Calling from phone is Functional and User Experience and performance is non functional.
3. Capacity Estimation - Scale at which we will build our app. Useful in infrastructure decision.
4. Defining all the components and communication between them.
HLD is generally done by management and program team. It is also called **Macro Level Design** and input criteria to HLD is SRS(Software Requirement Specification)

### LLD (Low Level Design)
Here we do in-depth and detailed design of each and every component mentioned in HLD. And it include more of technical stuff compared to HLD.
**Some components of LLD are:**
1. IP Address.
2. Class, Sequence, Activity diagrams.
3. VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) and Port Numbering.
4. Information about processes/services.
5. External Interface requirement and hardware/software interfaces.
6. Design and Implementation constraints.
7. Different class and interfaces.
8. Algorithm and Pseudocodes.
LLD is kind of reviewed HLD. And generally used by implementors or coding team.

## Why System Design is important?
1. During Software development if we want to be futuristic and make scalable apps, our foundation design must be strong and that is possible with only good system design.
